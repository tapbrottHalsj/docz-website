# Creating Themes

One of main features of Docz is if you want to create your own theme from scratch and just use data from parsed Docz you can do this in a very easy way. We provide a bunch of components that can help you to create your own theme without pain.

## Setting theme filepath

First of all, you need to set the path of your theme in the [Project Configuration](/documentation/project-configuration) by changing the `theme` property:

```js
// doczrc.js
export default {
  theme: 'src/my/theme/path',
}
```

## Creating your theme component

Then just create your component and export default it using the [`theme()`](/documentation/components-api) high order component as a enhancer:

```js
import React from 'react'
import { theme } from 'docz'

const Theme = () => <div>My badass docz theme</div>

export default theme()(Theme)
```

In fact if you just create something like above you shouldn't have nothing too much usefull to show. So, is important that you use the docz [built-in components](/documentation/components-api) to help you create beautiful documents pages and use the parsed data from data to mount menus and other things.

## Default theme configuration

Each theme has your own default `themeConfig` object to define whatever you want to turn customizable. It's very usefull when you want to set custom fonts, colors, spaces and some styles properties.

```js
import React from 'react'
import { theme } from 'docz'

const Theme = () => <div>My badass docz theme</div>

const themeConfig = {
  colors: {
    primary: 'tomato',
    secondary: 'khaki',
    gray: 'lightslategray',
  },
}

export default theme(themeConfig)(Theme)
```

By default docz we use this object as default configuration and will merge it with the `themeConfig` setted in the project configuration. Using together with the `<ThemeConfig>` component you can do a lot of things, like use css-in-js theming or retrieve props from your `themeConfig` in a deep render component.

```js
import React from 'react'
import { theme, ThemeConfig } from 'docz'
import { ThemeProvider } from 'emotion-theming'

const Theme = () => (
  <ThemeConfig>
    {config => (
      <ThemeProvider theme={config}>
        <div>My theme</div>
      </ThemeProvider>
    )}
  </ThemeConfig>
)

const themeConfig = {
  colors: {
    primary: 'tomato',
    secondary: 'khaki',
    gray: 'lightslategray',
  },
}

export default theme(themeConfig)(Theme)
```

## Preview of Documents

How we explain in the components api section, `<DocPreview>` is the component responsible to render the page of your document. It works like a `<Route>` component, but fetching and parsing data from your docs and creating a code splitting automatically for you.

Something very powerfull here is that you can pass a `components` prop for the component, creating something like a map that will be used to render inside your mdx file, since all default tag writed in mdx files are converted to components you can customize however you want any html tag used in the markdown

```js
import React from 'react'
import { theme, ThemeConfig, DocPreview } from 'docz'
import { ThemeProvider } from 'emotion-theming'

import * as components from './my-components'

const Theme = () => (
  <ThemeConfig>
    {config => (
      <ThemeProvider theme={config}>
        <DocPreview
          components={{
            page: components.Page,
            notFound: components.NotFound,
            render: components.Render,
            h1: components.H1,
            h2: components.H2,
            h3: components.H3,
            h4: components.H4,
            h5: components.H5,
            h6: components.H6,
            ul: components.List,
            loading: components.Loading,
            table: components.Table,
            pre: components.Pre,
            inlineCode: components.Code,
          }}
        />
      </ThemeProvider>
    )}
  </ThemeConfig>
)

const themeConfig = {
  colors: {
    primary: 'tomato',
    secondary: 'khaki',
    gray: 'lightslategray',
  },
}

export default theme(themeConfig)(Theme)
```

This is powerfull because it force you to write base components and create a default style for each one that will be used along the entire documents without need to repeat none of them.

## Getting data from documents

So far you almost have a entire theme component. But just with the code above you will see just a document page without any link or information about all documents do you have. Create something like a menu with all documents is essencial to create navigation.

You can do this easilly by using the `<Docs>` and `<Link>` component.

The first one will give to you information about all documents parsed from docz and the second one hability to navigate to them. First of all, create something like a `<Menu />` component (we using a menu just to illustrate here):

```js
// Sidebar.js
import React from 'react'
import { Docs, Link } from 'docz'

const Menu = () => (
  <Docs>
    {({ docs }) => (
      <ul>
        {docs.map(doc => (
          <Link key={doc.id} to={doc.route}>
            {doc.name}
          </Link>
        ))}
      </ul>
    )}
  </Docs>
)
```

Now you have a fully functional navigation to your documentation and you can simple use it your `<Menu />` component inside your theme:

```js
import React from 'react'
import { theme, ThemeConfig, DocPreview } from 'docz'
import { ThemeProvider } from 'emotion-theming'

import { Menu } from './Menu'
import * as components from './my-components'

const Theme = () => (
  <ThemeConfig>
    {config => (
      <ThemeProvider theme={config}>
        <div>
          <Menu />
          <DocPreview
            components={{
              page: components.Page,
              notFound: components.NotFound,
              render: components.Render,
              h1: components.H1,
              h2: components.H2,
              h3: components.H3,
              h4: components.H4,
              h5: components.H5,
              h6: components.H6,
              ul: components.List,
              loading: components.Loading,
              table: components.Table,
              pre: components.Pre,
              inlineCode: components.Code,
            }}
          />
        </div>
      </ThemeProvider>
    )}
  </ThemeConfig>
)

const themeConfig = {
  colors: {
    primary: 'tomato',
    secondary: 'khaki',
    gray: 'lightslategray',
  },
}

export default theme(themeConfig)(Theme)
```

You can still use this component to create other things like a search component, some custom page or whatever came in your mind.

## Using documents settings

Other really interesting thing that you can do when you're creating your own theme is use the `<Page>` component of your components map to customize the document preview depending on each document settings. Since each document can have your own settings defined in the top of mdx file and the `Page` component receive a prop called `doc` that's the doc rendered at the route, you can use this settings to create page variations, like that:

Let's suppose that some pages of your documentation should have a hero image, but some don't. You can give a `hero` property for your document, and base on that prop you'll show or not the hero:

```markdown
---
name: Hello world
hero: /my/hero/img.png
---

# Hello world

This is just a page!
```

After define the hero page of your document, let's see how your `Page` component will look:

```js
import React from 'react'

import MyCoolHero from './MyCoolHero'

export const Page = ({ doc, children }) => (
  <div>
    {doc.hero && <MyCoolHero img={doc.hero} />}
    {children}
  </div>
)
```

Simple as that! Now you can create a lot of variations of your documents page.

How I told you, without pain and a lot of work your you can have a very custom and functional theme for your documentation. So, let's create your own theme and share with the community!

## Examples

If you wanna see a example of theme created, you can see the [source code](https://github.com/pedronauck/docz-website) of this website that was entire build using docz or the [source code](https://github.com/pedronauck/docz/tree/master/packages/docz-theme-default) of `docz-theme-default`.
