# Documentation

Docz was built with a lot of programming concepts, techniques and tools and works all of this process by running together always thinking about performance and create a very explicit architecture inside it. So, how we're thinking big and we can build something that will be really usefull for you, we thinking that you can learn and improve even more your process to write your documentation and create tools that can help other people two.

## Architecture

We take a long time to arrive at a model that we can achieve all our goals and building something maintanable and consistent, a simple model to be scalable, easy to understand and maintain. So, After a few tries, we arrived at this architecture:

Explaining better this image: basically, in a very summed up way you have some **bundler** that will get information of your **project configuration** and **plugins**, parse your entries using MDX and setup your theme with this configuration and data.

So, in this sections we'll explain a little bit deep about how docz works and how you can customize even more your documentation and create plugins and themes!
