# Writing MDX

MDX is something really cool when it comes to writing documents and pages because it combine the readability of markdown with the expressivity and power of components. This make MDX so powerfull. According to the [specification](https://github.com/mdx-js/specification), it came because:

> <h3>Why MDX?</h3>
> In order to ensure a vibrant ecosystem and community, tooling needs to exist for formatting, linting, and plugins. This tooling requires a foundational specification and abstract syntax tree so that parsing is properly handled before transforming to JSX/Hyperscript/React/etc and potentially leveraging existing plugin ecosystems.

## Working with components

If you want to know more about how MDX works, parse and transpile files, it has a [good specification](https://github.com/mdx-js/specification) that's a really good read. But now, we'll assume that you just need to know that with MDX you can use your components inside your markdown files, just that!

But how? Let's take a look how we can improve our `.mdx` created in the previous session by importing and using some component inside it:

```markdown
---
name: Hello world
---

import { Button } from './Button'

# Hello world

Hello, I'm stil a mdx file, but now I have a button component!

<Button>Click</Button>
```

And, if you really have a `Button` component to import, you'll see something like that:

> <h3>Note</h3>
> It's important to tell that by some mvp reasons, until now docz just works with React components. But stay calm, we working to bring Preact, Vue and some others libraries to inside!

Although MDX is very powerfull, it's very simple too, there's nothing more to know to work with MDX, is just that. With this in mind we open a hole new world of possibilities using markdown and components together and Docz can possible to turn this experience even so better for you to write your docs.

So, now both we know how MDX works and what it can do, see how Docz can help you to [documenting your things](/introduction/documenting-your-things) by using our helper components!
