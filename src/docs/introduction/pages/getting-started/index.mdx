# Getting Started

## Installation

Be easy is one of our core principles. So, to getting started with docz is something really easy and quick. First of all, you need to install docz on your project using some package manager (we're assuming [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) here):

```bash
$ yarn add docz --dev
```

> ### Tips and tricks
>
> After you got docz on your project can be a good choice put two scripts on `package.json` to run docz for you, this an **optional step** but very usefull:

```json
{
  "name": "mycoolproject",
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "docz dev",
    "build": "dovz build"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "docz": "latest"
  }
}
```

Now you can up your dev server just running:

```
$ yarn dev
```

## Using

With your dev server up, you can start to write your documents.

Docz use [MDX](https://github.com/mdx-js/specification) as standard format because of your flexibility that turns possible you write JSX inside markdown files. Really cool, no?

One thing that is very important here is that you **don't need to follow any strict files architecture**, you can just create your `.mdx` files **anywhere on your project**.

> ### Important
>
> To improve build time, we limit read and parse files inside the `src/` folder. You can change this setting by changing [project configuration](/documentation/project-configuration).

So, let's create our first `.mdx` file and give it a name:

```markdown
---
name: Hello world
---

# Hello world

Hello, I'm a mdx file!
```

> The only required thing here that you need to docz can parse your file is the attribute `name` that you set in the top using yaml configuration style.

With server up and your first `.mdx` file created, if you open your browser and visit `localhost:3000` you should see something like that:

Easy, right?

Now that you know how start with docz, see [next session](/introduction/writing-mdx) where we'll talk a little bit more about MDX and how you can use it to write your documents!
