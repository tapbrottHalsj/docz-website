# Customizing

One of the greatest pain, when you're working with tools that allow you to create documentation and develop your components, is that is ~impossible~ very difficult to customize and impress your brand style. In most cases, you have just a few limited features to do that, or you need to create everything from scratch.

Docz was created with this pain in mind. In order to make customizing simple and give liberty and velocity to you without the need to create your things from scratch, we allow you to modify everything that you want, from the bundler configuration to a sidebar menu color of your documentation.

In this section, you'll explain a little bit about what you need to do that!

## Project configuration

The first most important thing is your project configuration. How you now Docz is a zero-config tool. This is ~very hyped~ good but our effort to be zero-config is just to get out of your face the willingness to start a project. We know that you want to customize a lot of things. So, to make this possible we have a very complete project configuration that allows modifying by your own tasty!

Create your own configuration is very easy, just add some `doczrc.js` file in the root of your project like that:

```js
// doczrc.js
import { myCoolPlugin } from 'docz-plugin-mycoolplugin'

export default {
  title: 'My Cool Project',
  description: 'This is my awesome documentation',
  theme: 'my-coolest-theme'
  themeConfig: {
    colors: {
      primary: 'tomato',
    },
  },
  modifyBundlerConfig: config => {
    /* do your magic here */
  },
  plugins: [
    myCoolPlugin()
  ]
}
```

Don't be scared with these properties, we'll explain more about it above, but if you can see all details about the file configuration in the [Project Configuration](/documentation/project-configuration) section.

## Documents settings

Looking over here, document settings can be something simple, but it has a lot of power. It is defined in the top of `.mdx` using yaml and can change the layout or whatever the theme can define when using these settings. By default there are some basic properties that all documents can have:

```mardown
---
name: My Document
route: /custom-route
order: 1
menu: Documents
---
```

These properties are very basic but good to help you to improve your document navigation. We don't have to much to explain about, because how can you see they are very explicit, but basically they have this definition:

- `name` Define the name of your component.
- `route` Define the route of your component. By default, if you don't pass any route, we'll use some kinda slug that is a filepath of your file with a route format.
- `order` You can sort your document here if you want to show it above or below other documents
- `menu` If you can group your documents in a single menu, you can do that changing this prop.

If we stopped here, perhaps you couldn't do many customizations with this properties. So, all documents could have whatever property you want to define and your theme will lead with these properties.

Example: you can define if your document is a page with `100%` width or not, just by defining some property like that:

```
---
name: My Document
fullpage: true
---
```

So, now when you're creating your theme or maybe using some that lead with this settings, you'll have a full page document instead of a container.

This is very powerful and can give you flexibility when developing or using custom themes.

## Themes

By running docz and write your first `.mdx`, when you open your browser you'll see a page like we saw until now:

What you see above is our [docz-default-theme](https://github.com/pedronauck/docz/tree/master/packages/docz-theme-default). It's very minimalist, but have what you need to write a beautiful documentation.

### Creating themes

Themes are the **one of the greatest things** in Docz. With they you can modify the entire layout of your documentation, define how you'll show your docs pages, menus and even create custom settings for each document.

If you want to create your own theme, we have a [full section](/documentation/creating-themes) talking about that. After choosing a theme or create your own, just set the theme path in your configuration file:

```js
// doczrc.js
export default {
  theme: 'my-coolest-theme',
}
```

### Modifying existents

So, we talking about creating themes from scratch, this is good and sometimes can be very necessary depending on how big is your project and how much time you have to build your own theme. But this is not always what you want, sometimes you need just to modify some colors, fonts, spaces or whatever another thing that have in your mind.

Docz is awesome because that, it makes possible for you to create your own theme from scratch in a very simple way or just modify some properties of the chosen theme like that:

```js
// doczrc.js
export default {
  themeConfig: {
    colors: {
      primary: 'tomato',
    },
    styles: {
      h1: {
        fontSize: 100,
      },
    },
  },
}
```

With just these few lines you can modify your theme:

The `themeConfig` property is that make this possible. It's just an object that every theme can define in your creation and use along the theme components. This is very flexible because you can create your own theme with some default configuration and give the user the capability to modify by your own tastes.

## Plugins

Another thing that can speed up your development process is Plugins. This concept is very used and disseminated nowadays in a lot of good tools because with it you can modify a bunch of processes and tailoring the project to your needs just by plugging some packages.

Use a plugin in docz is something very ease. Just install the plugin that you want to use and call it on your project configuration like that:

```js
// docsrc.js
import { myPlugin } from 'docz-plugin-myplugin'

export default {
  plugins: [myPlugins()],
}
```

As you can see, a plugin is just a function passed in an array. This is very simple and powerful. You can see more about how to create a plugin and the plugin's API in the [Creating Plugins](/documentation/creating-plugins) section and see all plugins create until now in the [Plugins](/plugins) menu.
