# Introduction

Libraries that make our life easier coming up every day. Styleguides and design system are growing so fast. Today, tools that allow us to be quick and effective in what we are doing are really necessary. We can't lose time with tasks that should be trivial for us. Thinking about that **docz** came out.

Documenting our things is one of the most important and heavy processes when you're creating something new. We waste a lot of time with unnecessary setups to build something that can represent and we want with our own style.

## Principles

When you want to create a design system or even a simple documentation for your project, you have so many different ways to do that. Looking over these alternatives, we got the best parts of them to fill the missing pieces of each one and build a tool with these principles:

- **Zero config and easy to learn.** No unnecessary build steps with confusing setups.
- **Blazing fast.** Built with performance in mind from the start.
- **Easy to customize.** Create something that will be easy to use and customize.
- **MDX Based.** Have the best standard to write documents.
- **Pluggable.** Plugins are the best choice when you need a custom and flexible solution.

Now you know our core principles. Go ahead and let's [Get it Started](/introduction/getting-started)!
